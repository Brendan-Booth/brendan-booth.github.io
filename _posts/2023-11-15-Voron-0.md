This is an open source 3d printer that I printed and assembled with the help of a kit. I learned a lot about printers building, and maintaing this project. It currently has ~600 print hours, mostly from my autonumus boat project. I have had to replace the hotend twice and the themistor once as well as tuneing profiles.

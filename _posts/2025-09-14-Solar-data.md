This project is the first step of my big goal of making an autonomous boat that can travel from Newfoundland to Ireland. The goal of this project is to collect solar data for weather conditions that will be similar to those of the voyage. This data will let me make informed decisions about solar panel, hull, and motor size, and thus is necessary before I start designing the boat.

The Solar Collector is a made from two parts. the first is a small 10w solar panel on the end of a 2x4x10 that can be attached to a railing or fence. The other is a bucket I got from Kent which serves as a durable splash resistent enclosure for the electronics. The electronics themselves are made made from a 12v 18Ah AGM lead acid battery that is placed

This is an open source 3d printer that I printed and assembled with the help of a kit. I learned a lot about printers building, and maintaining this project. It currently has ~600 print hours, mostly from my autonomous boat project. I have had to replace the hotend twice and the thermistor once as well as tuning profiles.

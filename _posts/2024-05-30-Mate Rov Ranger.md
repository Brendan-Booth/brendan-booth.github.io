This is a summary of 3 years of competing in The MATE ROV Ranger competition. I have focused more on he 2023-204 year since it is more representative of my current skills.

2023-2024 Comp Overview

In 2023-2024 I was CEO of the team, as well as lead designer. This meant I spent a lot of time teaching my team members skills, such as onshape, and 3d printing. Meanwhile at home i would design the robot and source comonents. For this year we went with a vectored thrust setup with four lift motors. However we didn't have the budget to buy good motors for the lift so instead I found some really cheap ones that we used instead. These didn't come with their respective propellers and unfourtunatly we didn't get enough testing in beforehand to ensure our 3d printed props were properly. Thus accents and decents were much slower than they should have been. There was also a large issue with space inside the electronics tube leading to a speed controller getting damaged and catching fire. This meant we had to forfeit the second competition run but had it working again my the third run! Unfourtunatly the lift problems were still there so we got a very low score. However besides these issue everything worked great!

2023-2024 Tool Design 

I was also in charge of the tool design for this year. I decided to go with a four pronged tool driven by a stepper motor. The stepper motor and top stage of the gearbox were later switched out for servo motors when it was realized the motor did not provide enough torque for the claw. This also could have been caused my us not ptoperly controlling the stepper motor.

2021-2023 Comp Summaries

Both in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 the robot suffered from fairly chatastrophic flooding of the main electronics enclosure since we were using an old damaged tube from previous years. In 2022-2023 we could get about 1min of runtime before the water shorted someting in the enclosure and cut the power supply. in 2021-2022 we basically had no run time or control of bot.

-2022-2023 bot not providing link because at this point I didn't understand componets, thus the whole assembly was one component.

-2022-2023 claw

I dont have any documentation for the 2021-2022 year besides the tinkercad modle the arm I made for the team. It had 3 points of actuation and was controlled by strings pulled by servos in enclosures I thought would be waterproof. It worked in air though!

This project was done as part of my Intro to Coding class. It was done in collaboration with Julia Butt (linkedin.com/in/julia-butt-805297247) and was a final project for the course. It was also a competition against all the other student's final projects, with prize money for the top three. It turned out to be the winning project!

It is a small robot dog controlled by 4 servo motors. Two of these motors are used for pushing the robot off the ground to give enough clearance for the other set of legs to swing without intersecting with the ground. We designed all the 3d printed parts ourselves and had to switch to a different API given to us by the class. To explain, the class was taught in Python, but the labs were done on Arduino, therefore they provided us with a translator. However, the translator they provided couldn't do multiple servo outputs at the same time, therefore, we switched to pyfirmata. For my coding abilities, it was very much a headache, but we got it working!

-We did a video explaining the project for the second round of competition.

Here is the shape link to the Onshape document, it's not the tidiest since the main focus of the project was the coding.

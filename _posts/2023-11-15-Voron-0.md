This is an open-source 3d printer that I printed and assembled with the help of a kit. I learned a lot about building and maintaining printers. It currently has ~600 print hours, mostly from my autonomous boat project. I have had to replace the hotend twice and the thermistor once, as well as tune profiles. I have also learned a lot about Klipper, the software that runs on the printer.

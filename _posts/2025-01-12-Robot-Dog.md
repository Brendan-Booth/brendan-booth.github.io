This project was done as part of my intro to coding class. It was done in collaboration with Julia Butt (linkedin.com/in/julia-butt-805297247).

It is a small robot dog controlled by 4 servo motors. Two of these motors are used for pushing the robot off the ground to give enough clearance for the other set of legs to swing without intersecting with the ground. We designed all the 3d printed parts ourselves, and had to switch to a different api the given to us by the class. To explain the class was taught in python but the labs were done on arduinos, therfore theyprovided us with a translator. However the translator they provided could't do multible servo outputs at the same time, therefore we switched to pyfirmata. For my codeing abilities it was very much a headache but we got it working!

-Video we did explaining the project for the second round of competition, as of when I write this results aren't out yet.

Here is the onshape link to the document, its not the tideyest since the main focus of the project was the codeing.

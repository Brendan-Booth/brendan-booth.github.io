*Unfourtunatly I am still working on this I got about 2 days of solid data and then for some reason the current sensor seems to have shifted its output and now reads incorrect measurements, athere are also a couple changes I need to make such as adding a load to burn excess energy and isolating the sensors more to improve reading accuracy. When the panel is working these two feed update with live data which is pretty sick and worked great for a couple days. I think I could probably figure this out with a couple days of working on it but school is picking up so i have to focus on that for a bit.
